To run the application,

Step1: go to "terminal" if you are using linux, or "cmd" if you are using windows

//for insertion

Step2: run below command

                   g++ Insertion.cpp -lm


Step3: Now run "./a.out"



//for Accessing

Step2: run below command

                   g++ Accessing.cpp -lm


Step3: Now run "./a.out"




//for Searching

Step2: run below command

                   g++ Searching.cpp -lm


Step3: Now run "./a.out"



Note:
You will get the two plotted graph.
To get the observable result, use smaller value for the "Number of points:" like 1000
Also rememeber that the output depends on the system specification on which the code has been compiled.
If you used system with very high specification, you won't be able to see the differnce hence you should use 
system with moderate system specifications.

And in the plotted graph, x-axis denotes the point and y-axis denotes the time taken
